# mckeown-parkinsons-eeg-microstates

Jupyter notebook for microstate research on Parkinsonian data.

Papers addressing Parkinsonian microstates already exist, but we are interested in time-embeddings and slightly different features (based around repetitive brain 'meta-states', not microstates).

The approach was a preliminary feature extraction and t-tests to see if there was *any* kind of interesting correlation to explore further (especially within time-embedded or entropy-based features which might relate to meta-states).

TODO: obfuscate data and include an anonymized dummy version of our dataset (to run).

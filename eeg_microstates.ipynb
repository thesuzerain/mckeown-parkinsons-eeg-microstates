    "Electroencephalography (EEG) records the brain's electrical potential at discrete spatial sampling sites, defined by the locations of the electrodes on the skull. We also call the potential distribution at a given time a topography, or a map. The idea behind the microstate algorithm is to represent the EEG time series by a small number of maps that yield an optimum representation of the full data set. As in other areas of data compression, optimality can be defined in different ways. For EEG microstates, the criterion of choice is that of maximum explained variance. To this end, a (large) set of EEG samples is fed into a clustering algorithm whose output is a reduced set of representative EEG topographies, also called termed microstates, or microstate maps.  \n",
    "The EEG time series can then be represented by a sequence of microstate labels, where each time point of the original EEG data is mapped to the microstate with the maximum spatial correlation to the actual EEG topography. Polarity is usually ignored, so the squared correlation coefficient between each candidate microstate map and the EEG topography is used as a similarity measure.  \n",
    "With a set of representative microstates at hand, the multi-channel EEG data set can be compressed into a time series of symbols, i.e. microstate labels. Most frequently, four microstates are used to compress the EEG data set, and the microstates are labelled A, B, C, D. The EEG data set is therefore transformed into a microstate sequence that could read like ...AAABBDCDABBDAB...  \n",
    "Due to the special, non-metric nature of the new state space {A, B, C, D}, many common time-series methods such as the autocorrelation function cannot be applied to the microstate time series. We therefore test several entropy-based measures based on Shannon's information theory to quantify these time series.  "

The figure below shows a section of resting state EEG for a selection of the 30 channels recorded. At each time point, the spatial standard deviation of the EEG topography is also called global field power (GFP, blue). Topographies at local maxima of the GFP time series (MAX, red dots) define the input to the modified K-means clustering algorithm.  \n",
    "Step 2: The microstate time series is computed by competitive back-fitting of the microstate maps into the EEG time series.  \n",
